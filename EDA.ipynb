Here’s a structured approach I follow to perform a perfect EDA.\n","\n","## **1. Dataset Summary**\n","\n","### Before diving into detailed analysis:\n","\n","Check the shape, size, and types of columns.\n","Identify missing values, memory usage, and basic info.\n","This provides a general understanding of the dataset and its structure.\n","\n","\n","## **2. Categorize Columns**\n","\n","### Divide the dataset into:\n","\n","1. Numerical columns – e.g., Price_USD, Year, Mileage_KM.\n","2. Categorical columns – e.g., Model, Color, Fuel_Type.\n","\n","This categorization helps in selecting the appropriate analysis and visualization techniques.\n","\n","## **3. Univariate Analysis**\n","\n","Univariate analysis focuses on examining each feature independently.\n","\n","### **Objectives**\n","\n","- Understand the distribution of the data.\n","- Identify potential issues like outliers, skewness, and missing values.\n","-  Determine the type of statistical tests or models applicable.\n","\n","# Key Concepts\n","\n","### **Shape of Distribution:**\n","\n","- **Normal**: Symmetrical, bell-shaped.\n","- **Skewed**: Asymmetrical (right or left skewed).\n","- **Bimodal**: Two peaks.\n","- **Uniform**: All values have equal probability.\n","\n","###**Dispersion**: Measures how spread out the data is.**\n","\n","- **Range**: Difference between max and min.\n","- **Variance**: Average squared deviation from the mean.\n","- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance.\n","- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Spread between 25th and 75th percentile.\n","\n","## Steps for Numerical Columns**\n","\n","\n","### **a.Descriptive Statistics:**\n","\n","\n","Compute mean, median, mode, std, quartiles, and range.\n","\n","\n","### **b.Visualizations:**\n","\n","\n","Use histograms, boxplots, and density plots to examine distributions.\n","\n","\n","### **c.Identify Outliers:**\n","\n","\n","### **d.Use visualizations to detect outliers.**\n","\n","\n","Decide whether they are errors or valid extreme values.\n","\n","\n","### **e.Check Skewness:**\n","\n","\n","Consider data transformations or robust statistical methods if skewed.\n","\n","\n","### **f.Conclusion:**\n","\n","\n","Summarize findings and decide the next steps.\n","\n","\n","## **4. Bivariate Analysis**\n","\n","Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two columns.\n","\n","\n","###**Step 1: Select Columns**\n","\n","Choose any two columns you want to analyze, which could be:\n","\n","Numerical – Numerical\n","Numerical – Categorical\n","Categorical – Categorical\n","\n","###**Step 2: Understand Relationship Type**\n","\n","Numerical – Numerical\n","\n","Visualizations: Scatterplots, Regression plots, 2D Histograms, 2D KDE plots.\n","Statistics: Correlation coefficient to check linear relationships.\n","\n","Numerical – Categorical\n","\n","Visualizations: Bar plots, Box plots, KDE plots, Violin plots, Scatterplots.\n","Purpose: Compare numerical distributions across categories.\n","\n","Categorical – Categorical\n","\n","Tables: Cross-tabulations or contingency tables.\n","Visualizations: Heatmaps, Stacked bar plots, Treemaps.\n","\n","### **Step 3: Conclusion**\n","\n","Summarize patterns or insights observed.\n","Decide whether to perform feature engineering, transformations, or modeling.\n","\n","## **5. Final Notes**\n","\n","A good EDA workflow ensures you fully understand the dataset, detect issues, and prepare features for analysis or modeling.\n","\n","Proper documentation and conclusions at each step improve reproducibility and clarity for anyone reviewing your work."],"metadata":{"id":"8q6x-7w2m-W4"}}]}
